# Flight-Price-Prediction-System
This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts flight ticket prices using a Random Forest regression model. It processes journey date, time, source, and destination inputs, applies machine learning for price prediction, and displays estimated airfare through a user-friendly web interface.
